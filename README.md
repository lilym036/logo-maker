    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

## Tests
Install jest and 'npm run test' in the terminal to view/run tests. The lib folder contains the test folder with different test files. 

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
